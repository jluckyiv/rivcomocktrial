# Power Matching Analysis — 2026 Competition

## The Rules (5.5A–E)

Riverside County Mock Trial uses power matching for
Rounds 2–4 of the preliminary competition:

- **5.5A — Power matching:** Teams are paired by win/loss
  record. Winners play winners; losers play losers.
- **5.5B — Side switching (R1→R2):** Round 1 prosecution
  teams switch to defense in Round 2 and vice versa.
- **5.5C — Side assignment (R3):** The higher-ranked team
  in each pairing switches sides from its previous round.
- **5.5D — Side switching (R3→R4):** Round 3 prosecution
  teams switch to defense in Round 4 and vice versa.
- **5.5E — Within-bracket ordering:** The team with the
  highest cumulative percentage faces the team with the
  lowest cumulative percentage within each bracket.
- **5.5M — Cumulative percentage:** Sum of a team's
  Court Totals divided by the sum of both teams' Court
  Totals across all rounds played.
- **No rematches:** Teams will not face the same opponent
  twice in the preliminary rounds (5.5B–D).

## The Hole: Cross-Bracket Ordering

Rule 5.5E says top-vs-bottom *within* each win/loss
bracket, but is **silent** on how to order pairings that
cross brackets. Side-switching constraints (R1↔R2,
R3↔R4) force many pairings to cross bracket boundaries
because teams in the same bracket often played the same
side in the prior round.

Two possible interpretations:

- **High-high:** Best remaining upper-bracket team faces
  best remaining lower-bracket team.
- **High-low:** Best remaining upper-bracket team faces
  worst remaining lower-bracket team.

## 2026 Data: Cross-Bracket Pairings

### Round 2 (R1 P→R2 D, R1 D→R2 P)

After R1, 13 teams are 1-0 and 13 are 0-1.

- 1-0 winners who played P in R1 (must play D in R2):
  4, 8, 22 → **3 available as D**
- 1-0 winners who played D in R1 (must play P in R2):
  1, 2, 9, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 25, 27 → **10 available
  as P**
- Only 3 within-bracket (1-0 vs 1-0) pairings possible
- Remaining 10 pairings must cross brackets

**Actual R2:** 6 within-bracket, 7 cross-bracket.

| Pairing                     | Brackets | Type    |
|-----------------------------|----------|---------|
| Notre Dame (9) v Paloma V (23) | 1-0 v 0-1 | Cross |
| Santiago (2) v J.W. North (19) | 1-0 v 0-1 | Cross |
| MLK (27) v Great Oak (21)  | 1-0 v 0-1  | Cross   |
| Ramona (16) v Chaparral (22) | 1-0 v 1-0 | Within |
| Poly (13) v Murrieta V (4) | 1-0 v 1-0  | Within  |
| Temecula V (12) v La Quinta (6) | 1-0 v 0-1 | Cross |
| St. Jeanne (25) v Vista (3) | 1-0 v 0-1 | Cross   |
| Indio (15) v Patriot (5)   | 1-0 v 0-1  | Cross   |
| Canyon Spr (11) v Palo V (24) | 0-1 v 0-1 | Within |
| Hemet (20) v Centennial (26) | 1-0 v 0-1 | Cross  |
| Heritage (14) v San Jac (28) | 0-1 v 0-1 | Within |
| Liberty (17) v Valley V (10) | 0-1 v 0-1 | Within |
| Palm Desert (1) v Norco (8) | 1-0 v 1-0 | Within  |

### Round 3 (fresh R3↔R4 pair)

Side switching resets: no constraint from prior rounds.
Rule 5.5C assigns sides based on rank.

**Actual R3:** 0 cross-bracket — all 13 pairings are
within-bracket.

### Round 4 (R3 P→R4 D, R3 D→R4 P)

After R3: 4 teams at 3-0, 9 at 2-1, 9 at 1-2, 4 at 0-3.

- 3-0 teams: 1 (D in R3), 9 (D in R3), 12 (D in R3),
  13 (D in R3) → all must play P in R4
- 0-3 teams: 3 (D in R3), 14 (P in R3), 17 (D in R3),
  24 (P in R3) → 14 and 24 must play D; 3 and 17
  must play P

All four 3-0 teams need to play prosecution. No 3-0 team
can face another 3-0 team (same side). All 3-0 vs
opponents must be cross-bracket.

**Actual R4:** 5 within-bracket, 8 cross-bracket.

| Pairing                       | Brackets | Type    |
|-------------------------------|----------|---------|
| Santiago (2) v Indio (15)     | 2-1 v 2-1 | Within |
| Ramona (16) v St. Jeanne (25) | 2-1 v 2-1 | Within |
| Poly (13) v Great Oak (21)   | 3-0 v 1-2  | Cross  |
| Palo Verde (24) v Cent. (26) | 0-3 v 1-2  | Cross  |
| Temecula V (12) v Chap. (22) | 3-0 v 2-1  | Cross  |
| Canyon Spr (11) v San J (28) | 1-2 v 1-2  | Within |
| Patriot (5) v Valley V (10)  | 2-1 v 2-1  | Within |
| Palm Desert (1) v MLK (27)   | 3-0 v 2-1  | Cross  |
| Vista (3) v Paloma V (23)    | 0-3 v 1-2  | Cross  |
| Norco (8) v Murrieta V (4)   | 1-2 v 1-2  | Within |
| Heritage (14) v La Quinta (6) | 0-3 v 1-2 | Cross  |
| Liberty (17) v J.W. North (19) | 0-3 v 1-2 | Cross |
| Notre Dame (9) v Hemet (20)  | 3-0 v 2-1  | Cross  |

## Impact: High-High vs High-Low

In R4, all four 3-0 teams must play cross-bracket
opponents (2-1 teams). Under **high-high**, the best 3-0
team faces the best 2-1 team — punishing top teams by
giving them the strongest possible opponents from the
lower bracket.

Under **high-low**, the best 3-0 team faces the worst
available 2-1 team — preserving the intent of power
matching by rewarding higher-performing teams with
weaker opponents when cross-bracket pairing is forced.

The 2026 competition used high-high ordering, which
meant the strongest 3-0 teams faced the strongest 2-1
opponents.

## Within-Bracket Ranking

Rule 5.5E specifies that within each bracket, the
highest-ranked team faces the lowest-ranked team. Ranking
is determined by cumulative percentage (Rule 5.5M):

```
cumulative % = sum(team's Court Totals)
             / sum(both sides' Court Totals in team's trials)
```

This is computed across all rounds played so far. It is
**not** point differential — a team that wins narrowly
in high-scoring trials may rank higher than one that
wins by larger margins in low-scoring trials.

## Side Assignment in Round 3

Rule 5.5C: in Round 3, the higher-ranked team (by
cumulative percentage) switches sides from its previous
round. This determines which team plays prosecution and
which plays defense in the R3↔R4 pair.

## Recommendation

Make cross-bracket strategy configurable. Default to
high-low to preserve power matching intent. Document the
choice so competition organizers can make an informed
decision.
