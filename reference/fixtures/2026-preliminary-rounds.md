## Scoring Rules (from 2025–2026 Handbook)

- **Scale:** 1–10 per category, 5 is the baseline
  (Rule 5.4A–B)
- **Weighted categories:** Pretrial motion (x2) and
  closing arguments (x2) (Rule 5.4D)
- **Judging panel:** 2–5 scoring attorneys; presider
  does not score but casts tiebreaker ballot
  (Rule 5.2A, C)
- **Court Total:** Sum of all scorers' weighted scores
  per side, plus clerk (to P) and bailiff (to D);
  higher Court Total wins
- **Ties:** Presider's ballot decides (Rule 5.5F)
- **Pairing:** Round 1 is random; Rounds 2–4 use power
  matching based on win/loss record (Rule 5.5A)
- **Side switching:** Round 1 prosecution → Round 2
  defense and vice versa; Round 3 prosecution →
  Round 4 defense and vice versa (Rules 5.5B, D)
- **No rematches:** Teams will not face the same
  opponent twice in preliminary rounds (Rule 5.5B–D)
- **Advancement:** Top 8 teams after 4 rounds advance
  to Elite 8 (Rule 5.5G)

## Known CSV Data Issues

Court Totals in this document use the **official result
PDFs** as the authoritative source. Two CSV entries
diverge from the PDFs:

1. **R1 Dept 2G** — Imari Rodriguez cross-exam scores
   of "10" were captured as "1" in the Google Form for
   all 3 scorers (D total: CSV=425, PDF=452). The PDF
   value (452) is correct.
2. **R2 Dept 52** — Scorer "Devin McComber" submitted
   the form twice, creating a 5th duplicate ballot.
   The official result PDF uses 4 scorers (P=560,
   D=556). The CSV sum of all 5 entries is P=708,
   D=703.

Neither issue affects the winner determination.
